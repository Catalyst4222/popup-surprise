## Details

This small program originated from wanting to play a transparent video on my desktop. After a bit of research, I found that not many video players support transparency, and not in the way that I wanted. However, WEBMs support transparency, electron can play WEBM files, and electron can create transparent windows. With a bit of work, I was able to make a single command start a FNAF Foxy jumpscare. This repo is the result of that, plus a few extra features.

To switch what's shown, edit `config.js`. Videos can be set to close after playing, and images can show for any period of time. Transparency is supported, as per the original goal. PNGs, GIFs, and WEBMs will show whatever is on the desktop behind them, but there's no simple way to add click-through.
